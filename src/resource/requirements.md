Hi Jannatul,

I am looking to receive a custom quote for a two-stage project including an MVP and Final Project.
My dream is to create an app that matches mentor users to mentee users. I want it to foster genuine
connection and growth in a professional environment. The onboarding for this will ask a series of
questions that match users based on their values, goals and preferences. Mentors must be 25+ and
mentees must be 18-40.

Features:

Secure channel to chat and voice call

Mentee progress tracker and checklist for both users to see.

I0S and Android accessibility

Profile matching algorithm based on values, communication styles, needs, shared life experiences,
and availability.

Ability to make interest based group chats with all users.

Store user profiles: email, passwords, name, user tracking
Notifications (calendar reminders, checklist reminders, messages)
Integrated calendars

Communication prompts

Ability to take credit card and PayPal payments

Please advise!
```
